      <p>After the twenty-sixth circuit, (Exploded found that counting trivial things helped relieve his nerves) he, having significantly tired, landed and rested against the stone wall of his cave.</p>

      <p>As it curved upward steeply, it wasn’t very comfortable, but would do for now.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>He estimated that if the commander would call him today, it would be now, or soon enough.
</p>

      <p>He reflected on what it would be like: entering the intricately decorated archway, adjusting to the strangely dim light (the commander’s cave was on the highest level, and also near the exit) having the commander stare at him, his very eyes boring into Exploded’s mind.
</p>

      <p>Exploded sometimes considered this to be true, especially during meetings. Just before any dragon could ask a question, he’d answer it, to everyone’s shock.
</p>

      <p>Whether this was simply a talent for predicting the most common questions, or whether the commander had telepathic abilities Exploded didn’t know, but he didn’t think the second possibility was very likely.
</p>

      <p>A sharp, direct voice broke into his reverie as a messenger stepped into Exploded’s cave:
</p>

      <p>“The commander wants you at his audience immediately.”
</p>

      <p>It was incredibly dull, simply standing there. Sometimes, he got the feeling that he was an alien species, and he was under examination.</p>

      <p>With this statement, the messenger turned abruptly and left. Exploded wondered at this strange way of the messengers. The messengers were part of the Fittus, and treating the other dragons somewhat rudely didn’t exactly promote unity, which could be disastrous in battle.
</p>

      <p>But Exploded shook off these thoughts and entered the maze that were the passages which led to all the caves in the system.
</p>

      <p>Exploded knew only the routes which he needed to know; the one to the exit, another to the commander’s cave, one back to his cave from both locations, and from the commander’s cave to the exit.
</p>

      <p>As Exploded was permitted to roam the passages, he’d found shortcuts and alternate paths to all these locations, and so took the shortest one to the commander’s cave to avoid irritating him.
 </p>

      <p>Even so, the route was long, as Exploded’s cave was a few levels lower. The path was tiring as well, as the shortest path involved flying as fast as possible without bludgeoning himself against the walls, constant inclines, and sharp turns.
</p>

      <p>All this constituted to Exploded’s exhaustion as he at last landed before the entrance. He hesitated slightly before walking inside, mentally preparing himself.
