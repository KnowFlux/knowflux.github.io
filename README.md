## 🎨 The Design Vibe

We believe stories should *pop*! Our site is a love letter to classic gaming aesthetics mixed with modern literary flair:
- **Neon-Sharp Visuals:** Bold borders and chunky shadows that leap off the screen.
- **Electric Palette:** The iconic **KnowFlux Blue** (`#4392F1`) and **KnowFlux Orange** (`#F46036`).
- **Typography with Attitude:** `Anton` for headers that demand attention and `Open Sans` for a smooth reading experience.
