      <p>Immediately, he straightened and assumed the position every Fittus member was taught when in the presence of the commander.</p>

      <p>Exploded had heard that, against tradition, the commander had dictated the position himself rather than keeping the more common one. It was profane, he knew.
</p>

      <p>But no one had enough audacity to question the commander’s decision, not even the second-in-command; and for a good reason.
</p>

      <p>“Well, well,” said the commander.
</p>

      <p>His voice was low but smooth, emitting danger, and his eyes were black, calculating, intimidating.
</p>

      <p>His position, his gait, everything about him indicated a cunning warrior: trusting no one, caring about nothing.
 </p>

      <p>He could betray without a hint of remorse, kill without a twinge of conscience.
</p>

      <p>His large wings, pristine teeth, sharp claws, and muscular body allowed no contradiction.
</p>

      <p>“I have summoned you here for an arrangement of democracy,” the commander said.
</p>

      <p>Exploded could barely contain his confusion – his thoughts burst with questions.
</p>

      <p>The commander had never said anything over than three words to Exploded, yet know – now the commander was to speak with Exploded about something that not even the second-in-command would hear about!
</p>

      <p>Exploded was further shocked as the commander continued, “An overall shift in the balances of power which I have decreed, and were followed for more than thirty years.”
</p>

      <p>The commander’s tone had changed: from an icy calm to an added hint of glee and triumph.
</p>

      <p>“Those disappointed by this decision will be calmed and excited again by the chance to rise in position, as high as second in command.”
</p>
      <p>Exploded struggled to follow what the commander was speaking about through his own feelings. Second in command? He thought hazily. Power?
