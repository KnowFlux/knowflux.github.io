        <summary>About Book</summary>
        <p>Exploded has been living with the Fittus, a dragon organization located in an underground cave system, for as long as he can remember – and he can remember nothing else. Not his past, not where he was born, not how he came to the Fittus, not who his parents were, and not even where his parents are. So when a series of inexplicable events mix impossibility with reality, he doesn’t know whether these events are a result of his own mind – hallucinations, something – or whether the Fittus is somehow causing them. The only way to learn the truth is to escape the Fittus. The largest problem: once you enter the Fittus, you may never leave. Exploded attempts it anyway – and when a series of fatal mistakes endanger his life and ensnare him in a web of lies, traps, and death, escape seems inconceivable. The chances of his survival are even bleaker. Friendless and alone in a dark, deadly world, he must rely on the only dragon he can: himself.</p>
