     <p>But there was no time to reflect on what the commander was saying, as he continued speaking.</p> 
      
      <p>“I vividly remember a law which I decreed over twenty years ago. I called the second-in-command by my side, and I called all the Fittus members in an assembly. I then spoke, ‘Shall any dragon betray the Fittus, they shall be exiled immediately, with no trial.’ ”</p>
      
      <p>Exploded knew of this law; all Fittus members knew it, and were constantly reminded of it.</p>
      
      <p>“Betrayal will become prominent in this new era of glory, and many shall leave. But just as many shall join, as they now see their chance to become someone. How many are judged as worthless, forced to submit to those of greater strength and intelligence than they?</p>
      
      <p>“But if all are given a test suited to their abilities, a dragon organization can become more powerful as all contribute to the wellbeing of the aforesaid organization.”</p>
      
      <p>Exploded found himself agreeing with the commander – this was entirely true.</p>
      
      <p>The commander had paused for some time, and, somewhat disoriented from his confusion, imprudently opened to his mouth to speak. The commander stepped forward sharply to warn Exploded not to stay silent.</p>
      
      <p>To Exploded’s somewhat subdued shock, the commander answered the very question which Exploded had been about to ask –</p>
      
      <p>“You wonder why this is important?”</p>
      
      <p>The commander’s faced changed ever so slightly into an expression so fleeting that Exploded could not tell what it was.</p>
      
      <p>“It is important, Exploded, because you are the newest member of the Fittus. Do you wish to achieve a higher ranking?</p>
      
      <p>“Yes. All do, especially the younger generation. I have spoken before about the shift of power in the Fittus.</p>
      
      <p>“Currently, a group votes on the laws which I pass, and also decide whether or not a dragon will be promoted depending on my recommendation.</p>
      
      <p>“Of course, I have the final say, but this shall be no more.</p>
      
      <p>“Although the group will still vote on laws, they shall not decide position: tests that I pass forth will.</p>
      
      <p>“It is not exactly ‘fair ground’ for one to uproot and then kill the commander of a group seeking to destroy the Fittus from the inside: this requires first intelligence, and then strength.</p>
      
      <p>“However, this before is what would promote a dragon. But I will create false situations suited to the abilities of the dragons to decide their ranks. They, of course, will not be aware that the tests are unnatural. Only you know this. You may leave.”</p>
