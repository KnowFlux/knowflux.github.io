      <p>Commander-in-chief of the Royal Empire of the Fittus was fuming.</p>

      <p>“Why were you worthless guards altering the formation? I clearly mentioned that you were not to change your formation, not even in the most dire of situations till I give the command!”</p>

      <p>“But-”</p>

      <p>The guard was not allowed to finish, because the commander-in-chief struck his chest. He did this with such force that the guard flew several feet before he fell to the ground, unconscious.</p>

      <p>“Now,” said the commander, “remove your unworthy selves from my presence. All of you.”</p>

      <p>He spat on the ground and spread his wings, flying back to the underground cave system that was the home of all Fittus members. He had other, more important duties better than some heap of worthless guards.</p>

      <p>Instead, the commander would pace around Exploded, a faraway look in his eyes. Then he would finally notice Exploded, and he would say three words:</p>

      <p>‘You may leave.’</p>

      <p>Then the faraway look would return. Occasionally, the commander wouldn’t call him, and Exploded sincerely hoped for this.</p>

      <p>It was incredibly dull, simply standing there. Sometimes, he got the feeling that he was an alien species, and he was under examination.</p>

      <p>This could be the reason he was unable to remember his past. All he knew was that he’d been living with the Fittus for the past two years.</p>

      <p>The only result of his constant attempts to remember were a falling sensation, and an echoing, repeating his name.</p>

      <p>Currently, Exploded was in the third position. For every year there, his position increased by one. After the third position, however, he knew he had to do something for the Fittus to be promoted again. He was in the third position; two years there, plus automatically being in the first position when he joined.</p>

      <p>This was another event he couldn't recall - he didn't know when he'd joined the Fittus, or how, or even why. </p>

      <p>He’d seen only too many dragons go against the commander’s orders, and he’d seen their punishments: demotions. However, he suspected there was something more, because of those dragons’ weary, subdued look afterwards.</p>

      <p>He resumed his pacing. The commander was probably dealing with guards, a welcome thing for Exploded, as it might cause the commander to not call on Exploded. He doubted this though.</p>

      <p>He stopped pacing and instead started flying circles around his cave. At least it was better than pacing.</p>
